# Heart Disease Detection
Heart disease is a disease of serious concern in global health. Early prediction of the likelihood of heart disease is essential to provide appropriate intervention and reduce the risk of death. In this case, the application of technology in the field of machine learning and data science is a promising solution. The problem arises when we need to choose the most effective algorithm for prediction. Several popular algorithms such as decision tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), random forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost have been the focus of research in this regard. Each algorithm has certain advantages and disadvantages that need to be identified and compared to determine the best performance in heart disease prediction. Furthermore, the results of the comparison will be implemented in the form of an application using the Streamlit platform, by choosing XGBoost as the main algorithm to deploy the prediction model. Thus, this research aims to present a solution that is not only effective in heart disease prediction, but also user-friendly through the web interface generated by Streamlit.
